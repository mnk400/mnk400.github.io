This is a recipe for a Ricoh GR III that I use every day. This started as Reggie's recipe but, with minor changes over time, evolved into a completely different recipe.

This is based on a positive film base simulation. This recipe isn't aiming to reproduce any particular film but rather serves as a good base for everyday use.

*I also encourage everyone to shoot film if you can! :)*

# Manik's Color Positive Recipe

- Film Simulation: Positive Film
- Saturation: +1 (or +2)
- Hue: 0
- High/Low Key: 0
- Contrast: +2
- Contrast (Highlight): -3
- Contrast (Shadow): -1
- Sharpness: +1
- Clarity: 0
- Shading: +1
- Highlight Correction: Auto
- Shadow Correction: Medium
- High-ISO Noise Reduction: Off
- White Balance: Auto
- WB Compensation: M1:1 B1:1

This recipe can potentially be reproduced on older Ricoh GR cameras if they support a positive film simulation.
