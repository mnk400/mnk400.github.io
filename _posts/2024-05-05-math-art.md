    <p>
        This page shows artwork rendered mathematically on my Raspberry Pi, using matrix multiplication. The algorithm
        runs every hour and the image is then rendered on an e-ink display mounted to a frame on my desk.
    </p>
    <p>
        This page loads the last 20 generated artwork images directly from the Raspberry Pi live. Following is how the
        frame looks visually:
        <img src="/assets/images/rpi-art.jpg" />
        You can checkout the code and more about the functionality on the <a
            href="https://github.com/mnk400/pi-frame-art-gen">Github repository.</a>
