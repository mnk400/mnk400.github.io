This is my personal fork of [13ft](https://github.com/wasi-master/13ft){:target="_blank"} by wasi-master, which is itself a similar project to the famous paywall bypassing service 12ft.

13ft can help you detect paywalls on the internet by pretending to be GoogleBot (Google's web crawler) and trying to fetch the same content Google does.

This fork overhauls the UI and adds fallback options for Wayback Machine and Archive.is.
