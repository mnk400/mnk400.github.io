        This page shows artwork rendered using a mathematical algorithm I wrote, which essentially multiplies a bunch of matrices together to produce a pretty-looking graph. 
        This algorithm runs on my Raspberry Pi and produces an image every hour, which is then rendered on an e-ink display mounted to a frame on my desk.

        This page loads the last 20 generated artwork images directly from the Raspberry Pi live. Following is how the frame looks visually:
        <img src="/assets/images/rpi-art.jpg"/>
        You can checkout the code and more about the functionality on the <a href="https://github.com/mnk400/pi-frame-art-gen">Github repository.</a>
