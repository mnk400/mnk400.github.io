Hi! I am <b>Manik,</b> a graduate student from <b>Northeastern University</b> in Boston, and I currently live in PNW. My current technical work includes writing complex software systems for <b>Amazon.</b> I've worked with various technical paradigms either professionally or as a hobby: Including but not limited to Fullstack Development, Internet of Things, Robotics, Automation, and Machine Learning. 

Outside of tech, you'll probably find me listening to some music, reading, or struggling to figure out what I eat for dinner. 

I also am an amateur photographer who sometimes likes to post to Instagram, though not often(check out the link from the top bar!).
