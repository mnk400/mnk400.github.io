Hi! I am <b>Manik</b>, Graduate student from the <b>Northeastern University</b> Boston and I currently live in PNW. My current technical work incldues writing complex software systems for <b>Amazon</b>. I've worked with various technical paradigms either professionaly or as a hobby including but not limited to Fullstack Devleopment, Internet of Things, Robotics, Automation, and Machine Learning. 

Outside of tech you'll probably find me listening to some music, or reading, or struggling over deciding what to eat for dinner tonight.

I also am an amateur photographer who sometimes likes to post to instagram, though not often(check out the link from top bar!).
