I am a computer systems engineering graduate student at The Northeastern University in Boston, with a portfolio and interests that includes working in fields like Internet of Things, Robotics, and Machine Learning.


# Setup
I've got a hybrid setup running WSL in windows, Linux, and macOS as well. My setup files, which are shared across all systems can be found in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/mnk400/dotfiles).
