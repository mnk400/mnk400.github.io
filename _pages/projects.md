- [Virtual Reality Integration for Surveillance and Exploration Vehicles]()

My undergrad major project, currently still being worked upon. The main focus of this project was to develop and introduce 360-Degree Virtual Reality Video for remote controlled vehicles used in the field, tackling networking and hardware issues. The project currently uses only FOSS hardware and software, and everything developed will be released as FOSS as well.
- [PiHole Info]()

Program to read and display information from your Pi-Hole on your terminal screen. Made using python, the script utilised the Pi-Hole API.
- [Weather Station]()

A project created for an Internet of Things class I took in my undergraduate degree, the project utilised a Raspberry Pi, and Arduino, and a bunch of sensors which collected and analysed the current weather data(Temperature, Humidity, and Air Quality). The data was then logged and then presented on a dashboard and a linked twitter account further tweeted the weather summary periodically.

- [Link Aggregator]()

A link aggregating website similar to Reddit, Digg, etc. Programmed using Ruby on Rails and MySQL.
